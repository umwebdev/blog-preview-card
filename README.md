## Overview

This is the second challenge from my journey of taking Front End Mentor's challenges and I am already learning alot. This challenge involves creating a blog preview card with HTML CSS.

### The challenge

- Users should be able to See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Font sizes should be responsive for smaller screensizes but without using media queries.

## My process

#### 1. Analyzing the Design and Setting Up the Dev environment

First I analysed the design files and the design system for the Blog Preview Card, that helped with figuring out the reusable css classes and variables. also i set up the project folder with all the assets like images and fonts and created the required HTML and CSS files.

#### 2. Writing the HTML Markup

After setting up the dev environment and initializing the required HTML and CSS files, using HTML5 semantic tags, I started with the markup for the QR card component.

#### 3. CSS Styling and responsiveness

After writing the HTML markup, I started with styling of the blog preview card. setting up reuseable classes and CSS variables in the first step really helped speed up the process.

#### 4. Final touches, testing and deployment

I reviewed the code before pushing to github to fix any possible issues and make sure everything was in order. I made sure everything worked fine across all devices, browsers and different screensizes.

After making sure that everything was in order I pushed the code to the github repo and deployed on vercel.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- images should be set to display

```css
display: block;
```

or else they take up more vertical space than they actually are.

- clamp function for responsive font size values
